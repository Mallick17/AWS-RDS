# RDS Proxy

## Precautions to ensure both Data Integrity and Accurate Performance Measurements.
#### Environment Preparation
#### Configuration and Data Safeguards
- Enable automatic backups and verify snapshots restoration works before testing.
- If testing RDS Proxy, confirm connection settings, pool size, and authentication modes match production-like configuration.
- SSH into RDS and check everything.


## Test Cases for RDS DB to optimize
### Introduction to Testing RDS Proxy
Amazon RDS Proxy is a fully managed database proxy service that enhances connection management for Amazon RDS databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) by providing connection pooling, multiplexing, and faster failover handling. When integrating it with an existing RDS instance, these tests validate that the proxy improves scalability, reduces connection overhead, and maintains performance without introducing new issues. The tests you listed focus on core proxy behaviors like pooling efficiency, latency, and resource handling. Below, I'll explain **why** each test is important (tied to RDS Proxy's benefits like reducing failover times by up to 66% and preserving connections during outages) and **how** to conduct it using tools like pgbench (for PostgreSQL benchmarks), Apache JMeter (for load simulation), or simple scripts. Assume your RDS is PostgreSQL for examples; adapt for MySQL.

### 1. Connection Open/Close Speed Test
**Why?** RDS Proxy pools and reuses database connections, minimizing the CPU-intensive process of opening/closing connections (which can take 10-100ms each without a proxy). This test verifies the proxy reduces establishment latency, especially in high-churn apps like serverless workloads, preventing bottlenecks during spikes.

**How to Test:**
- **Tools:** Use pgbench or a custom Python script with psycopg2 (for PostgreSQL).
- **Steps:**
  1. Baseline: Connect directly to RDS (no proxy) and measure open/close times for 1000 connections using `timeit` in a loop (e.g., open, execute a simple SELECT, close).
  2. With Proxy: Repeat via RDS Proxy endpoint. Compare averages.
  3. Metric: Aim for <10ms open time via proxy vs. >50ms direct.
- **Expected Outcome:** Proxy should show 50-90% faster opens due to multiplexing.
- **Monitor:** CloudWatch metric `ClientConnections` for open rates.

### 2. Query Response Time Test
**Why?** The proxy adds a hop but reuses connections to cut per-query overhead. This test ensures no net latency increase (or even improvement) under load, identifying if pooling/multiplexing is working or if borrow timeouts are causing delays.

**How to Test:**
- **Tools:** JMeter or pgbench.
- **Steps:**
  1. Baseline: Run 1000 simple queries (e.g., pgbench TPC-B) directly to RDS.
  2. With Proxy: Route through proxy endpoint; measure end-to-end latency.
  3. Vary load: 10-100 concurrent users.
- **Expected Outcome:** Response time <5ms added latency; monitor `DatabaseConnectionsBorrowLatency` (should stay <1s).
- **Monitor:** Proxy logs for query traces; CloudWatch `QueryLatency`.

### 3. Throughput Test
**Why?** RDS Proxy enables higher transactions per second (TPS) by multiplexing (one DB connection serves multiple clients). This validates scalability for read/write-heavy apps, ensuring the proxy doesn't throttle under peak load.

**How to Test:**
- **Tools:** pgbench for TPS benchmarks or JMeter for distributed load.
- **Steps:**
  1. Baseline: pgbench with `-c 50 -t 1000` (50 clients, 1000 txns) direct to RDS; note TPS.
  2. With Proxy: Repeat via proxy; scale clients to 200+.
  3. Include reads/writes mix.
- **Expected Outcome:** 20-50% higher TPS with proxy due to pooling.
- **Monitor:** CloudWatch `DatabaseConnections` vs. `MaxDatabaseConnectionsAllowed`; aim for <80% utilization.

### 4. Session Pinning Behavior Test
**Why?** In Multi-AZ setups, RDS Proxy "pins" sessions to specific DB instances during failover to preserve state (e.g., temp tables). This test confirms pinning works without reducing multiplexing efficiency, avoiding stuck connections that waste resources.

**How to Test:**
- **Tools:** Custom app/script simulating stateful sessions (e.g., Python with session variables).
- **Steps:**
  1. Create a session with state (e.g., SET/DECLARE in PostgreSQL).
  2. Route through proxy; trigger failover (reboot primary RDS).
  3. Verify session state persists post-failover (query to check).
  4. Check logs for pinning events.
- **Expected Outcome:** No state loss; recovery in <30s (vs. minutes direct).
- **Monitor:** Proxy logs for "session pinning" entries; CloudWatch `FailoverDelay`.

### 5. Connection Pool Saturation Test
**Why?** When the pool hits limits (e.g., 95% of DB's `max_connections`), the proxy queues or rejects connections. This test simulates overload to ensure graceful degradation, preventing app crashes from connection exhaustion.

**How to Test:**
- **Tools:** JMeter with ramp-up to max connections.
- **Steps:**
  1. Set `MaxConnectionsPercent` to 80% in proxy target group.
  2. Ramp 1000+ clients querying continuously.
  3. Observe when saturation hits (e.g., via `ConnectionBorrowTimeout` default 120s).
  4. Baseline without proxy.
- **Expected Outcome:** Queued connections resolve without errors; latency spikes but recovers.
- **Monitor:** `DatabaseConnections` nearing `MaxDatabaseConnectionsAllowed`; adjust to 30% headroom.

### 6. Idle Client Timeout Efficacy Test
**Why?** Idle connections consume resources; RDS Proxy's `IdleClientTimeout` (default 30min) closes them to free pool slots. This test ensures stale connections are evicted promptly, optimizing for bursty workloads without premature drops.

**How to Test:**
- **Tools:** Script to open connections, idle them, then query.
- **Steps:**
  1. Open 100 connections via proxy; let idle for 20-40min.
  2. Attempt reuse or new query; measure closure.
  3. Vary `IdleClientTimeout` (e.g., set to 300s via `modify-db-proxy` CLI).
  4. Baseline: Direct RDS idles forever.
- **Expected Outcome:** Closures after timeout; pool reuses slots efficiently.
- **Monitor:** CloudWatch `ClientConnectionsIdle`; proxy logs for timeout events.

### Additional Tests for Downtime, Performance, and Bottlenecks
Beyond your list, these tests target microsecond downtime (e.g., during failover) and bottlenecks like I/O or network. RDS Proxy reduces failover to seconds by preserving connections, but validation is key.

| Test | Why? | How? | Tools/Metrics |
|------|------|------|---------------|
| **Failover and Downtime Test** | Detects even microsecond interruptions in Multi-AZ; proxy cuts recovery by 66%. | Trigger RDS failover (CLI: `reboot-db-instance --force-failover`); measure connection drop/reconnect time with active queries. Run under load. | JMeter for query continuity; CloudWatch `FailoverDelay` (<30s goal). Use `ConnectionBorrowTimeout` to tune wait. |
| **Read Replica Scaling Test** | Validates proxy with read-only endpoints for offloading reads, spotting replica lag bottlenecks. | Route reads to proxy read endpoint; load test with 70/30 read/write mix. | pgbench `--select-only`; Monitor `ReplicaLag`. |
| **Security and Secrets Rotation Test** | Ensures IAM/ Secrets Manager integration doesn't cause auth failures or downtime during rotation. | Rotate secrets; test connections mid-rotation. | AWS CLI for rotation; Proxy logs for auth errors. |
| **Bottleneck Profiling** | Identifies proxy-induced issues like high borrow latency or pinning reducing multiplexing. | Full load test; profile CPU/network. | Enhanced Monitoring (OS metrics); Proxy logs + CloudWatch Insights for queries >1s. |
| **End-to-End Integration Test** | Checks proxy+RDS compatibility (e.g., no version mismatches causing drops). | Migrate app traffic gradually; simulate production load. | Locust or Artillery for distributed testing; Compare pre/post metrics. |

**General Tips:**
- **Setup:** Create a dev RDS + proxy; use VPC endpoints for low-latency testing.
- **Automation:** Script tests in CI/CD (e.g., GitHub Actions with AWS SDK).
- **Thresholds:** No more than 1-2% error rate; <5% latency increase.
- **If Issues:** Tune settings like `MaxIdleConnectionsPercent` (default 50%) for idle pool size.

# Connection Open/Close Speed Test
## What Are We Testing?
You want to measure:
- **The latency and overhead of opening and closing connections** (especially at scale)
- **Resource impact** on the database and application during rapid connection churn
- **Pooling efficiency** and scalability from RDS Proxy vs direct DB connections

## Why Do This Test?
Opening and closing database connections is expensive and can strain your RDS instance, especially in bursty or serverless workloads. RDS Proxy pools and reuses connections, aiming to reduce this cost and avoid bottlenecks. By benchmarking both approaches, you see real savings in latency and resource usage, and you reveal any proxy overhead.[1][2]

## Step-by-Step: How To Run The Test

**A. Prepare Your Environment**
- Make sure your application/server (e.g., EC2 instance) is in the same VPC as both RDS and RDS Proxy endpoints. This ensures network latency is minimized for fair comparison.[1]

**B. Choose/Write a Benchmark Tool**
- For MySQL/PostgreSQL, use libraries like:
  - Go: [database/sql](https://pkg.go.dev/database/sql) with custom scripts (many open source examples available)
  - Python: [`mysql-connector-python`](https://mysql-connector-python.readthedocs.io/) or [`psycopg2`](https://www.psycopg.org/)
  - Sysbench (for MySQL): supports connection benchmarking
- Example Go benchmark tool (from ):[1]
  - `benchmarkOpen`: Each loop, open a NEW connection, run a simple query, close connection.
  - `benchmarkQuery`: Open connection ONCE, run repeated queries through it.

**C. Run the Benchmark**
- Run the test on both endpoints:
  1. **Direct RDS Endpoint:**
     - Loop N times (e.g., 1000):
       - Open connection
       - Run trivial query (e.g., SELECT 1)
       - Close connection
     - Measure average and total elapsed time.
  2. **RDS Proxy Endpoint:**
     - Repeat exact same steps as above, using RDS Proxy endpoint.
- Record per-loop and total time taken for each method.[1]

**D. Monitor Resource Impact**
- While test runs, observe:
  - CPU/Memory usage on RDS instance (CloudWatch)
  - Number of open connections
  - Proxy metrics (connections, pooling stats)

**E. Analyze Results**
- Compare latency per connection.
- Note any differences in total time, CPU/Memory consumption, open connection spikes, or pool efficiency.
- You should see lower latency and resource pressure after introducing the pool; any overhead from the proxy should be minimal for heavy workloads but might show up in microbenchmarks.[1]

## Reference Example
> "I copied the benchmark binary up to an EC2 server co-located with the RDS database and RDS proxy.... `benchmarkOpen` opens a connection and runs a query on each loop....
> Direct RDS: ~5.85ms per loop; RDS Proxy: ~7.09ms per loop—shows proxy adds a small overhead, but real benefit is at scale when pooling is active."[1]

## Summary
- **Why:** Ensures your pooling configuration actually reduces connection churn and improves scalability.
- **How:** Use looped connections + simple queries, comparing direct vs proxy endpoints, monitoring latency and resource impact.
- **Tools:** Custom scripts (Go, Python), sysbench, and real production code.
