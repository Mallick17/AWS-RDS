# Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)
Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the AWS Cloud. It provides cost-efficient, resizable capacity for an industry-standard relational database and manages common database administration tasks.
- Amazon RDS is a managed database service. It's responsible for most management tasks. By eliminating tedious manual processes, Amazon RDS frees you to focus on your application and your users.
- Amazon RDS provides the following principal advantages over database deployments that aren't fully managed:
  - You can use database engines that you are already familiar with: IBM Db2, MariaDB, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle Database, and PostgreSQL.
  - Amazon RDS manages backups, software patching, automatic failure detection, and recovery.
  - You can turn on automated backups, or manually create your own backup snapshots. You can use these backups to restore a database. The Amazon RDS restore process works reliably and efficiently.
  - You can get high availability with a primary DB instance and a synchronous secondary DB instance that you can fail over to when problems occur. You can also use read replicas to increase read scaling.
  - In addition to the security in your database package, you can control access by using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to define users and permissions. You can also help protect your databases by putting them in a virtual private cloud (VPC).

## Features of RDS
The service is designed to reduce the administrative burden, with AWS handling tasks such as provisioning, patching, backup, recovery, and scaling. Detailed features include:

- **Managed Service:** AWS automates undifferentiated heavy lifting, such as software patching and backup management, allowing you to focus on application development.
- **High Availability:** Multi-AZ deployments ensure failover support by maintaining a synchronous secondary instance, while read replicas enable scaling read operations(can create upto 15 read replicas), enhancing performance for read-heavy applications.
- **Security:** RDS integrates with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for fine-grained access control and supports Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for network isolation. Data encryption is available at rest using AWS Key Management Service (KMS) and in transit via SSL/TLS.
- **Monitoring and Metrics:** Tools like Amazon CloudWatch provide metrics for CPU utilization, storage, and latency, while Performance Insights offers deep visibility into database performance. Enhanced Monitoring logs metrics from the host operating system.
- **Automatic Backups:** Automated backups are enabled by default, with retention periods configurable up to 35 days. Manual snapshots can be taken for point-in-time recovery, ensuring data durability.

## Selection Considerations: Matching Workload to Resources
When choosing an instance family and DB engine for Amazon RDS, several factors should be considered to ensure optimal performance and cost-effectiveness:
- **Workload Requirements:**
  - For memory-intensive tasks, such as in-memory databases or large datasets, opt for memory-optimized instances (db.r*, db.x*, db.z*).
  - For compute-intensive tasks, such as data warehousing or complex analytics, choose compute-optimized instances (db.c*).
  - For variable workloads with occasional spikes, burstable-performance instances (db.t*) offer cost savings.
  - For general-purpose needs, db.m* instances provide a balanced approach.

- **Database Compatibility:**
  - Select a DB engine based on application requirements and existing infrastructure. For example:
    - Use MySQL or MariaDB for web applications with open-source preferences.
    - Use PostgreSQL for applications requiring advanced data types or complex queries.
    - Use Oracle or SQL Server for enterprise-level applications with specific ecosystem needs.
    - Use IBM Db2 for scalable, secure enterprise deployments.

- **Cost Considerations:**
  - Evaluate pricing for different instance families and DB engines. Burstable-performance instances (db.t*) are cost-effective for variable workloads, while memory-optimized (db.r*, etc.) may be more expensive but necessary for memory-heavy tasks.
  - Consider licensing costs for commercial engines like Oracle, SQL Server, and IBM Db2, which may impact total cost of ownership.

- **Scalability and Performance:**
  - Ensure the chosen instance family can scale as your application grows. Memory-optimized instances are ideal for large datasets, while compute-optimized instances handle heavy computational tasks.
  - Consider high availability features, such as Multi-AZ deployments, which are supported across all instance families and engines.

### Understanding Multiple Modules with Different Databases Types or Schemas on the Same RDS

#### Can We Create Multiple Schemas in RDS?
Yes, absolutely. In MySQL (and thus RDS MySQL), a "schema" is synonymous with a "database." An RDS instance can host multiple databases/schemas within the same instance, sharing the same resources (CPU, memory, storage). This is efficient for related modules/apps.

How to Create:
- Connect to your RDS instance (via endpoint, e.g., using MySQL Workbench).
- Run: `CREATE DATABASE schema1; CREATE DATABASE schema2;`
- Each schema can have its own tables, users, and permissions.
- Limits: No hard limit on databases per instance, but performance depends on instance size (e.g., t3.micro might handle 5-10 small schemas; scale up for more).

#### Different Modules/Types of Databases on the Same RDS
- **Scenario**: Suppose Module A (e.g., user auth) uses `schema1` with relational tables, Module B (e.g., logging) uses `schema2` with different structures. They share the same RDS instance for cost-efficiency.
- **Pros**: Centralized management, lower costs than separate RDS instances.
- **Cons**: Shared resources—if one schema has heavy load, it affects others. Use read replicas or separate instances for isolation if needed.
- **Different "Types"**: If you mean different database engines (e.g., MySQL vs. PostgreSQL), you can't mix them in one RDS instance—each RDS instance is single-engine. For multi-engine, use separate RDS instances or Aurora (which supports MySQL/PostgreSQL compat but still per-cluster).

#### How Various Schemas Interconnect
- **Cross-Schema Queries**: MySQL allows joining tables across databases if the user has permissions on both.
  Example (from a connection to any database):
  ```sql
  SELECT schema1.users.username, schema2.orders.order_id
  FROM schema1.users
  JOIN schema2.orders ON schema1.users.id = schema2.orders.user_id;
  ```
- **Permissions**: Grant access: `GRANT SELECT ON schema2.* TO 'user_from_schema1'@'%';`
- **Best Practices**: Use a dedicated user per module with limited grants (e.g., only SELECT on foreign schemas). Avoid tight coupling—prefer APIs/microservices for inter-module communication to reduce direct DB dependencies.
- **In RDS**: Same as local MySQL. Monitor via RDS Performance Insights for cross-schema query impact.

# Connect to the RDS and Access the Database
## 🧭 Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

1. ✅ **RDS endpoint** (something like `mydb.xxxxx.ap-south-1.rds.amazonaws.com`)
2. ✅ **Database username** and **password**
3. ✅ **Database name** (optional, if you want to dump specific DB)
4. ✅ **MySQL client** installed locally (`mysql` and `mysqldump`)

To verify:

```bash
mysql --version
```

If not installed:

* **macOS**: `brew install mysql`
* **Linux (Ubuntu)**: `sudo apt install mysql-client -y`
* **Amazon Linux**: `sudo dnf install mariadb105` (works fine for MySQL)
* **Using MySQL Container Like Mentioned Below**

<details>
    <summary>Click to view Step-by-step Guide</summary>

## 🪜 Step-by-step Guide
### 1) Step 1: run MySQL with `docker run` (fastest)

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
# pull + run MySQL 8 container (root password=rootpass, db=appdb)
docker run --name local-mysql \
  -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=rootpass \
  -e MYSQL_DATABASE=appdb \
  -p 3306:3306 \
  -d mysql:8.0
```

What this does:

* Exposes MySQL on `127.0.0.1:3306`
* Root password = `rootpass`
* Creates `appdb` initially

Wait a few seconds for the container to initialize. Check logs:

```bash
docker logs -f local-mysql
# press Ctrl+C after you see "ready for connections"
```

### **Step 2: Test DB connection**

Try connecting directly:

```bash
mysql -h <RDS_ENDPOINT> -u <USERNAME> -p
```

Example:

```bash
mysql -h mydb.xxxxxx.ap-south-1.rds.amazonaws.com -u admin -p
```

If you can connect and see the MySQL prompt — ✅ connection works.

### Troubleshooting

| Problem                           | Likely Cause                         | Fix                                              |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `Can't connect to MySQL server`   | Security group not open / IP changed | Recheck inbound rules                            |
| `Access denied`                   | Wrong username or password           | Verify credentials                               |
| `mysqldump: Got error: 1044/1045` | Permission issue                     | Ensure user has `SELECT, LOCK TABLES` privileges |

### Case 1: Backup **a specific table** from a database

Let’s say:

* Database: `Ola`
* Table: `bookings`

Run:

```bash
mysqldump -h <RDS_ENDPOINT> -u <USERNAME> -p Ola bookings > ~/bookings_backup.sql
```

Example:

```bash
mysqldump -h mydb.xxxxx.ap-south-1.rds.amazonaws.com -u admin -p Ola bookings > ~/bookings_backup.sql
```

You’ll be asked for the password → then it creates a `.sql` file in your home directory.

✅ **Output file:** `/home/ec2-user/bookings_backup.sql`

---

### Case 2: Backup **a single database**

To dump the entire database (all tables, triggers, views, etc.):

```bash
mysqldump -h <RDS_ENDPOINT> -u <USERNAME> -p Ola > ~/Ola_backup.sql
```

You can compress it (optional):

```bash
mysqldump -h <RDS_ENDPOINT> -u <USERNAME> -p Ola | gzip > ~/Ola_backup.sql.gz
```

✅ **Output file:** `/home/ec2-user/Ola_backup.sql` or `.gz`

---

### Case 3: Backup **the entire RDS instance (all databases)**

Use `--all-databases`:

```bash
mysqldump -h <RDS_ENDPOINT> -u <USERNAME> -p --all-databases > ~/rds_full_backup.sql
```

Or compressed:

```bash
mysqldump -h <RDS_ENDPOINT> -u <USERNAME> -p --all-databases | gzip > ~/rds_full_backup.sql.gz
```

✅ **Output file:** `/home/ec2-user/rds_full_backup.sql`

## Optional: Add Timestamp for versioned backups

```bash
mysqldump -h <RDS_ENDPOINT> -u <USERNAME> -p Ola > ~/Ola_$(date +%F_%H-%M).sql
```

This creates files like:

```
Ola_2025-10-21_15-30.sql
```

### Restore Commands (if needed later)

Restore to another database:

```bash
mysql -h <HOST> -u <USER> -p <DB_NAME> < ~/backup.sql
```

### Tips

* Make sure the user you’re connecting with (`admin`, `root`, etc.) has **SELECT + LOCK TABLES** privileges.
* If your DB is large, you can add `--single-transaction` to avoid locking:

  ```bash
  mysqldump -h <RDS_ENDPOINT> -u <USERNAME> -p --single-transaction Ola > ~/Ola_backup.sql
  ```

# **Local MySQL Setup and RDS Proxy Simulation Lab**

## **Objective**

Set up a local MySQL environment to:

1. **Create a database and schema** that mirror an **Amazon RDS** setup.
2. **Simulate and analyze connection behavior** under concurrent load.
3. **Prepare for testing RDS Proxy–like connection pooling and query filters** locally (using ProxySQL in later steps).

### Step 1: Setting Up a Local MySQL Container Using Docker

To simulate an AWS RDS MySQL instance locally, we'll use Docker to run MySQL in a container. This provides an isolated environment that's easy to manage and closely mimics RDS (since RDS MySQL is based on standard MySQL). Prerequisites: Ensure you have Docker installed on your machine (download from docker.com if not).

#### 1.1 Pull the Official MySQL Docker Image
Open your terminal and run:
```
docker pull mysql:latest
```
This downloads the latest MySQL image from Docker Hub. You can specify a version like `mysql:8.0` if you want to match a specific RDS MySQL version (e.g., RDS supports up to MySQL 8.0.x).

#### 1.2 Run the MySQL Container
Run the container with a root password and expose the default MySQL port (3306):
```
# pull + run MySQL 8 container (root password=rootpass, db=appdb)
docker run --name local-mysql \
  -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=rootpass \
  -e MYSQL_DATABASE=appdb \
  -p 3306:3306 \
  -d mysql:8.0
```

What this does:  
- `--name local-mysql`: Names the container for easy reference.
- `-e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=rootpass`: Sets the root password (change this to something secure).
- `-d`: Runs in detached mode (background).
- `-p 3306:3306`: Maps the container's port 3306 to your host's port 3306 so you can connect from localhost.
> Creates `appdb` initially.

Verify it's running:
- You should see `local-mysql` in the list.
```
docker ps
docker logs -f local-mysql
# press Ctrl+C after you see "ready for connections"
```

#### 1.3 Access the MySQL Database
Connect to the MySQL shell inside the container:
```
docker exec -it local-mysql mysql -uroot -p
```
Enter the password (`rootpass`) when prompted. You'll be at the MySQL prompt (`mysql>`).

Alternatively, use a GUI tool like MySQL Workbench or DBeaver to connect to `localhost:3306` with user `root` and your password.

### Step 2: Creating the Database Schema and Tables (Mimicking RDS)

RDS MySQL instances start with a default database, but you can create multiple databases (schemas) and tables just like in standard MySQL. There's no difference in schema definition between local MySQL and RDS—RDS is managed MySQL.

#### 2.1 Create a Database
From the MySQL prompt:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE my_rds_like_db;
USE my_rds_like_db;
```

#### 2.2 Create Tables
Let's create a simple example schema with a `users` table (you can expand this to match your actual RDS schema):
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

Insert some test data:
```sql
INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES ('user1', 'user1@example.com');
INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES ('user2', 'user2@example.com');
```

Query to verify:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

This setup is identical to what you'd do in RDS. In RDS, you'd connect via the endpoint (e.g., `mydbinstance.abcdef123456.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:3306`) using the same SQL commands.

### Step 3: Testing Connections and Load (Understanding Connection Opening)

To observe how connections open under load, we'll simulate multiple concurrent requests. MySQL handles connections via its thread pool (configurable), but by default, each query opens a new connection if not pooled.

#### 3.1 Basic Connection Testing
From your host machine, use the `mysql` command-line tool (install via `brew install mysql` on macOS or `apt install mysql-client` on Ubuntu):
```
mysql -h localhost -uroot -p -e "SELECT 1;"
```
This opens a single connection, runs the query, and closes it. Repeat it multiple times to see basic behavior.

To monitor open connections in MySQL:
From the MySQL prompt:
```sql
SHOW PROCESSLIST;
```
This lists all active connections/threads.

#### 3.2 Load Testing with Sysbench
Install sysbench (a benchmarking tool) to simulate load:
- On macOS: `brew install sysbench`
- On Ubuntu: `apt install sysbench`

Run a simple read-only load test with 10 concurrent connections for 30 seconds:
```
sysbench oltp_read_only --db-driver=mysql --mysql-db=my_rds_like_db --mysql-user=root --mysql-password=rootpass --mysql-host=localhost --threads=10 --time=30 --report-interval=5 run
```
- This spawns 10 threads, each opening a connection and running queries.
- Watch the output for throughput, latency, and errors.

While running, in another terminal, connect to MySQL and run `SHOW PROCESSLIST;` repeatedly. You'll see up to 10+ connections (including your monitoring one). Without pooling, each thread opens its own connection, which can exhaust resources under high load.

MySQL's default max_connections is 151; you can adjust it in the container by adding `-e MYSQL_MAX_CONNECTIONS=100` to the `docker run` command, but restart the container.

### Step 4: Simulating and Optimizing for RDS Proxy Filters Locally (Connection Pooling)

RDS Proxy is an AWS service that sits between your app and RDS, providing connection pooling, multiplexing (reusing connections for multiple queries), and filters for query rewriting/monitoring. You can't run RDS Proxy locally, but you can simulate it using open-source tools like ProxySQL or Heimdall Data. We'll use ProxySQL as it's lightweight and supports similar features (connection pooling, query filtering/rewriting).

#### 4.1 Set Up ProxySQL in Docker
Pull and run ProxySQL alongside your MySQL container:
```
docker pull proxysql/proxysql:latest
docker run -d --name proxysql -p 6033:6033 -p 6032:6032 proxysql/proxysql
```
- Port 6033: For client connections (your app connects here instead of directly to MySQL).
- Port 6032: Admin interface.

Configure ProxySQL to point to your MySQL backend. Connect to ProxySQL admin:
```
docker exec -it proxysql mysql -uadmin -padmin -h127.0.0.1 -P6032
```
At the prompt, add your MySQL backend:
```sql
INSERT INTO mysql_servers (hostgroup_id, hostname, port) VALUES (10, 'host.docker.internal', 3306);
LOAD MYSQL SERVERS TO RUNTIME;
SAVE MYSQL SERVERS TO DISK;
```
- `host.docker.internal`: Points to your host's MySQL (from inside the ProxySQL container).
- Hostgroup 10: A group for read-write traffic.

Add a user for pooling (matching your MySQL root):
```sql
INSERT INTO mysql_users (username, password, default_hostgroup) VALUES ('root', 'rootpass', 10);
LOAD MYSQL USERS TO RUNTIME;
SAVE MYSQL USERS TO DISK;
```

#### 4.2 Enable Connection Pooling in ProxySQL
ProxySQL pools connections by default. Configure multiplexing:
```sql
SET mysql-multiplexing=1;
LOAD MYSQL VARIABLES TO RUNTIME;
SAVE MYSQL VARIABLES TO DISK;
```
This reuses backend connections for multiple frontend queries.

#### 4.3 Simulate RDS Proxy Filters (Query Rewriting/Routing)
RDS Proxy has "filters" for actions like pinning sessions or rewriting queries. In ProxySQL, use query rules:
Example: Rewrite a query to add a LIMIT if none exists (simulating a filter):
```sql
INSERT INTO mysql_query_rules (rule_id, active, match_pattern, replace_pattern, apply) VALUES (1, 1, '^SELECT \* FROM users$', 'SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 10', 1);
LOAD MYSQL QUERY RULES TO RUNTIME;
SAVE MYSQL QUERY RULES TO DISK;
```

Test by connecting through ProxySQL:
```
mysql -h localhost -P6033 -uroot -p -e "SELECT * FROM my_rds_like_db.users;"
```
It should apply the rewrite. Monitor connections: With pooling, `SHOW PROCESSLIST;` in MySQL will show fewer backend connections than frontend ones.

For load testing through the proxy, update sysbench:
```
sysbench oltp_read_only --db-driver=mysql --mysql-db=my_rds_like_db --mysql-user=root --mysql-password=rootpass --mysql-host=localhost --mysql-port=6033 --threads=10 --time=30 run
```
Compare `SHOW PROCESSLIST;`—with pooling, you'll see multiplexed connections (e.g., 1-5 backend vs. 10 frontend).

To understand completely:
- **Connection Pooling**: ProxySQL maintains a pool of reusable connections to MySQL. When a request comes in, it borrows from the pool instead of opening a new one, reducing overhead.
- **Optimization Tips**: Set `mysql-max_connections` in ProxySQL variables for pool size. Monitor with `SELECT * FROM stats_mysql_connection_pool;` in ProxySQL admin.
- This simulates RDS Proxy's pooling (which handles thousands of connections efficiently). In real RDS Proxy, you configure via AWS console, but the concepts are the same.

# **Local MySQL Setup and RDS Proxy Simulation Lab**

## **Objective**

Set up a local MySQL environment to:

1. **Create a database and schema** that mirror an **Amazon RDS** setup.
2. **Simulate and analyze connection behavior** under concurrent load.
3. **Prepare for testing RDS Proxy–like connection pooling and query filters** locally (using ProxySQL in later steps).

### 1) Quick: run MySQL with `docker run` (fastest)

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
# pull + run MySQL 8 container (root password=rootpass, db=appdb)
docker run --name local-mysql \
  -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=rootpass \
  -e MYSQL_DATABASE=appdb \
  -p 3306:3306 \
  -d mysql:8.0
```

What this does:

* Exposes MySQL on `127.0.0.1:3306`
* Root password = `rootpass`
* Creates `appdb` initially

Wait a few seconds for the container to initialize. Check logs:

```bash
docker logs -f local-mysql
# press Ctrl+C after you see "ready for connections"
```

<details>
    <summary>Click to view a compose file (recommended for repeatability), use the YAML in step 1b.</summary>

If you prefer a compose file (recommended for repeatability), use the YAML in step 1b.

#### 1b) (Optional) Docker Compose version

Create `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  mysql:
    image: mysql:8.0
    container_name: local-mysql
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: rootpass
      MYSQL_DATABASE: appdb
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "mysqladmin", "ping", "-h", "127.0.0.1", "-prootpass"]
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 10
```

Run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps
```

</details>

---

### 2) Connect to the MySQL instance

Option A — from host using `mysql` client (if installed):

```bash
mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3306 -u root -p
# enter: rootpass
```

Option B — using `docker exec` to run the client inside the container:

```bash
docker exec -it local-mysql mysql -u root -prootpass
```

You should get a MySQL prompt: `mysql>`

---

### 3) Create the schema and tables (paste into a file `schema.sql`)

Create a file `schema.sql` with this content:

```sql
-- schema.sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS appdb;
USE appdb;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    email VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
) ENGINE=InnoDB;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS orders (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    product VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    quantity INT DEFAULT 1,
    order_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
) ENGINE=InnoDB;
```

Load it into MySQL (from host):

```bash
mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P3306 -u root -prootpass < schema.sql
```

Or from inside container:

```bash
docker cp schema.sql local-mysql:/schema.sql
docker exec -it local-mysql mysql -uroot -prootpass < /schema.sql
```

Verify:

```sql
-- at mysql> prompt
USE appdb;
SHOW TABLES;
DESCRIBE users;
DESCRIBE orders;
```

---

### 4) Seed some data (simple script)

Create `seed.sql`:

```sql
USE appdb;

-- insert 100 users
INSERT INTO users (username, email)
SELECT CONCAT('user', seq), CONCAT('user', seq, '@example.com')
FROM (
  SELECT @row := @row + 1 AS seq FROM information_schema.columns, (SELECT @row := 0) init LIMIT 100
) s;

-- insert 1000 orders randomly
INSERT INTO orders (user_id, product, quantity)
SELECT FLOOR(1 + RAND() * 100), CONCAT('product', FLOOR(1 + RAND()*20)), FLOOR(1 + RAND()*5)
FROM (SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.columns LIMIT 1000) t;
```

Load it:

```bash
mysql -h127.0.0.1 -P3306 -u root -prootpass < seed.sql
```

Check counts:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM appdb.users;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM appdb.orders;
```

---

### 5) Observe connections (tools & commands)

Open Terminal A — to watch connection counts live:

```bash
# every 1 second, show threads connected and threads running (Linux watch)
watch -n 1 "mysql -h127.0.0.1 -P3306 -u root -prootpass -e \"SHOW STATUS WHERE Variable_name IN ('Threads_connected','Threads_running');\""
```

If you don’t have `watch`, use a tiny loop:

```bash
while true; do date; mysql -h127.0.0.1 -P3306 -u root -prootpass -e "SHOW STATUS WHERE Variable_name IN ('Threads_connected','Threads_running');"; sleep 1; done
```

Open Terminal B — to inspect processes / session list:

```bash
# interactive
mysql -h127.0.0.1 -P3306 -u root -prootpass -e "SELECT ID, USER, HOST, DB, COMMAND, TIME, STATE, INFO FROM information_schema.PROCESSLIST ORDER BY TIME DESC LIMIT 20;" 
```

You can also use:

```sql
SHOW PROCESSLIST;
-- or
SELECT * FROM information_schema.PROCESSLIST;
```

Performance schema queries (if you want deeper visibility):

```sql
SELECT VARIABLE_VALUE FROM performance_schema.global_status WHERE VARIABLE_NAME = 'Threads_connected';
SELECT * FROM performance_schema.threads LIMIT 20;
```

---

### 6) Load testing — simulate concurrent clients

#### Option 1: `mysqlslap` (simple)

If you have `mysqlslap` available (usually with `mysql-client`), run:

```bash
# a read-heavy test: many concurrent clients doing SELECT
mysqlslap --host=127.0.0.1 --port=3306 --user=root --password=rootpass \
  --concurrency=50 --iterations=10 --query="SELECT COUNT(*) FROM appdb.orders WHERE product LIKE 'product%';"
```

Parameters:

* `--concurrency=50` → 50 concurrent clients
* `--iterations=10` → how many times to repeat

#### Option 2: concurrent simple clients with `sysbench` (if installed)

Install sysbench, then run a simple OLTP read-only or read-write test. Example (read-only):

```bash
# prepare (if you want to use sysbench's oltp)
sysbench oltp_read_only --db-driver=mysql --mysql-host=127.0.0.1 --mysql-port=3306 \
  --mysql-user=root --mysql-password=rootpass --mysql-db=appdb \
  --tables=10 --table-size=10000 prepare

# run with concurrency 50 for 60 seconds
sysbench oltp_read_only --db-driver=mysql --mysql-host=127.0.0.1 --mysql-user=root --mysql-password=rootpass \
  --mysql-db=appdb --tables=10 --table-size=10000 --threads=50 --time=60 run

# cleanup afterwards
sysbench oltp_read_only ... cleanup
```

(Replace `...` with corresponding options as the prepare command.)

#### Option 3: custom small Python script (no extra installs)

If you have Python, this runs N threads that repeatedly query:

```python
# save as load_test.py
import mysql.connector, threading, time
from random import randint

def worker(id, iterations):
    cnx = mysql.connector.connect(host='127.0.0.1', port=3306, user='root', password='rootpass', database='appdb')
    cur = cnx.cursor()
    for i in range(iterations):
        uid = randint(1, 100)
        cur.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE user_id=%s", (uid,))
        cur.fetchone()
    cur.close()
    cnx.close()

threads = []
for i in range(50):  # 50 concurrent threads
    t = threading.Thread(target=worker, args=(i, 200))
    threads.append(t)
    t.start()

for t in threads:
    t.join()
print("done")
```

Run:

```bash
python3 load_test.py
```

---

### 7) Watch what happens while load runs

While `mysqlslap` or your script is running, look at Terminal A & B to see:

* `Threads_connected` rising to match concurrent clients
* `SHOW PROCESSLIST` showing many `Sleep` / `Query` states depending on timing
* `Threads_running` indicates currently active queries

You can also query:

```sql
SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'Connections';
SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'Threads_connected';
SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'Threads_running';
SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'Connection_errors%';
```

`Connections` is cumulative (how many connection attempts since server start). `Threads_connected` shows currently open sessions.

---

### 8) If you want to simulate connection pooling behavior (next step)

I won’t add it here since you asked to first set up MySQL + test connections. But quick preview: to mimic RDS Proxy connection pooling, you’ll run a MySQL proxy (ProxySQL or mysql-proxy) and point clients to the proxy; proxy maintains a pool of backend connections and multiplexes client requests. If you want, after you confirm this MySQL setup and tests worked, I’ll give you the ProxySQL Docker-compose + config and steps to repeat the same load while watching `stats_mysql_connection_pool` in ProxySQL.

---

### 9) Troubleshooting & useful tips

* If container fails to start: `docker logs local-mysql` and check for permission/volume errors.
* If `mysql` client complains about `Can't connect to MySQL server on '127.0.0.1'`: check `docker ps` and ensure port 3306 is mapped and container is healthy.
* To change max connections (temporarily):

  ```sql
  SET GLOBAL max_connections = 500;
  ```

  (To persist, pass `--characteristic` via my.cnf or container env — I can show an example file if you want.)
* To stop & remove:

  ```bash
  docker stop local-mysql && docker rm local-mysql
  # or for compose:
  docker compose down
  ```

---

If you’re ready, do these now:

1. Run the `docker run` (or `docker compose up`) command.
2. Load `schema.sql` and `seed.sql`.
3. Start the `watch` for `Threads_connected`.
4. Start `mysqlslap` (or run the Python load test).

### RDS Proxy Debug Incase If anything Fails

<details>
    <summary>Click to view</summary>

## 🧭 Overall Debug Strategy

When anything fails with **RDS Proxy**, your best friend for debugging is **CloudWatch Logs**, **RDS Events**, and **VPC Flow Logs** — together, they tell you *what failed, where, and why.*

To make this concrete, here’s how you’d handle failures per checklist section 👇

---

## 1. **Review Use Case and Limits**

### Possible Issues

* Proxy creation fails immediately.
* AWS Console or API returns error:
  `RDSProxyQuotaExceeded`, `UnsupportedEngine`, or `InvalidDBCluster`.

### Debug Steps

* **Check CloudWatch → RDS logs:** Look under *RDS > Events* for “Proxy creation failed” messages.
* **Check AWS Quotas → RDS Proxies per region:**
  → [Service Quotas Console → RDS → RDS Proxies per region]
* **Check Engine Support:**

  * `RDS Proxy` doesn’t support all Aurora or RDS engines/versions.
  * Use CLI:

    ```bash
    aws rds describe-db-proxies
    ```

    If your DB engine isn’t listed under supported ones → check [AWS RDS Proxy Compatibility Table](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-proxy.html#rds-proxy.supported-engines).

---

## 2. **Network and Subnet Planning**

### Possible Issues

* Proxy creation or connection fails with timeout.
* Proxy shows **“Creating”** for long time or **“Unavailable”** state.

### Debug Steps

1. **Check Subnet Availability:**

   ```bash
   aws ec2 describe-subnets --subnet-ids <subnet-ids>
   ```

   Ensure they are in **different AZs** and have available IPs (`AvailableIpAddressCount`).

2. **VPC Flow Logs:**

   * Enable for your VPC or specific ENI.
   * Look for *REJECT* entries from your app/ECS to RDS Proxy ENI.

3. **RDS Events:**

   * In the RDS Console → **Events** tab → filter for your proxy.

4. **Connectivity Test:**

   * From ECS/Bastion:

     ```bash
     nc -vz <proxy-endpoint> 3306
     ```

     or for PostgreSQL:

     ```bash
     psql -h <proxy-endpoint> -U <user> -d <db>
     ```

---

## 3. **Security Group Setup**

### Possible Issues

* Connection refused or timeout.
* “Access denied” or no route to host.

### Debug Steps

1. **Check Security Group Associations:**

   ```bash
   aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <sg-id>
   ```

2. Ensure inbound rule allows:

   * **Source:** ECS task/Bastion/App SG
   * **Port:** DB port (3306 for MySQL / 5432 for Postgres)

3. **Outbound rule:** usually `0.0.0.0/0` or `same VPC`.

4. **To isolate issue:**

   * Temporarily allow `0.0.0.0/0` inbound on port 3306 to test.
   * Once confirmed, tighten it back down.

5. Use:

   ```bash
   telnet <proxy-endpoint> 3306
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   mysql -h <proxy-endpoint> -u user -p
   ```

   to confirm traffic flow.

---

## 4. **Credential Preparation**

### Possible Issues

* Proxy fails to start or shows `Authentication Error`.
* Application logs show `Access denied for user`.

### Debug Steps

1. **Check Secrets Manager entries:**

   * Verify Secret ARN and JSON structure:

     ```json
     {
       "username": "db_user",
       "password": "db_pass"
     }
     ```

2. **Proxy IAM Role Permissions:**

   * Ensure it has:

     ```json
     {
       "Effect": "Allow",
       "Action": "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
       "Resource": "<secret-arn>"
     }
     ```

3. **RDS Proxy Target Group → Authentication Tab:**

   * Confirm the right secret is linked to the right user.

4. Test manually:

   ```bash
   mysql -h <proxy-endpoint> -u db_user -p
   ```

   If it fails here → not app issue → secret or permission problem.

---

## 5. **Application Inventory**

### Possible Issues

* Some modules fail while others succeed.
* Proxy only handles part of the load.

### Debug Steps

1. Review **DB connection strings** in application code or ECS task definitions:

   * Look for hardcoded DB hostnames still pointing to `database.cluster-xxxx.rds.amazonaws.com`.
2. Enable **App Logs or New Relic** DB connection tracing.
3. Compare connection counts:

   ```bash
   SHOW PROCESSLIST;
   ```

   Connections to proxy should show the proxy’s internal user or hostname.

---

## 6. **Connectivity Testing**

### Possible Issues

* App cannot connect even though proxy status is "available".
* Random `timeout` or `connection reset`.

### Debug Steps

1. **Direct Connection Check:**

   * Verify you can connect to RDS directly from same ECS host.
   * Then test the proxy endpoint.

2. **RDS Proxy Logs:**

   * In CloudWatch → Log Group `/aws/rds/proxy/<proxy-name>`
   * You’ll find authentication, network, and session errors.

3. **CloudWatch Insights Query Example:**

   ```sql
   fields @timestamp, @message
   | sort @timestamp desc
   | limit 20
   ```

4. **Connection Metrics:**

   * In CloudWatch → Metrics → `RDS → DBProxy`
   * Look at `ActiveConnections`, `ClientConnections`, `DatabaseConnections`, and `ConnectionsBorrowed`.

## Pro Tip — One-Click Sanity Check Script

If you’re deploying repeatedly, make a small **Bash precheck** script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Checking RDS Proxy prerequisites..."

aws rds describe-db-proxies > /dev/null && echo "✅ RDS Proxy API OK"
aws ec2 describe-subnets --subnet-ids $SUB1 $SUB2 > /dev/null && echo "✅ Subnets OK"
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids $SGID > /dev/null && echo "✅ SG OK"
aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id $SECRET_ARN > /dev/null && echo "✅ Secret OK"
nc -zv $PROXY_ENDPOINT 3306 && echo "✅ Connectivity OK"
```

This helps you detect *before* deployment what might fail.
